# AddressablesStorage

The AddressablesStorage package hosts remote builds of various asset files that are shared across Virtual Brain Lab projects. These files can be accessed by using the functions in the [AddressablesRemoteLoader](https://github.com/dbirman/vbl-core/blob/main/Scripts/Addressables/AddressablesRemoteLoader.cs) class found in the vbl-core repository.
